# GameMaker Studio 2 specific attributes
# --------------------------------------
# Force line endings to LF (Line Feed) for .yy and .yyp files.
# This is CRITICAL for cross-platform consistency (Windows uses CRLF, macOS/Linux use LF)
# and prevents spurious "changes" and merge conflicts due to line ending differences.
*.yy text eol=lf
*.yyp text eol=lf

# Mark .yy files as "linguist-generated" for GitHub/GitLab
# This prevents GitHub's language detection from misidentifying .yy files
# (which are JSON-like) as other languages, and also helps with diffing.
*.yy linguist-language=JSON linguist-generated
*.yyp linguist-language=JSON linguist-generated

# Ensure GML files are recognized as Game Maker Language
*.gml linguist-language=GameMakerLanguage
